- https://youtu.be/FmTRC9OfZRE
- Learn English language.
- Then look at English courses.
- Check course **Learning How to Learn** (https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome)
- Do not focus on one course.
  - One course as a **plan** 
  - Others as **additional** ones.
    - Pick the stuff you are **currently** learning.
- Use **internet + critical thinking** to find best materials.
  - Look at school courses they are understandable.
  - To choose course look at negative reviews
    -  If they are not constructive this is your course.
    -  If they are not then this is suspicious.
- Use **explain to me like i am 5**.
- Use **speedup**.
