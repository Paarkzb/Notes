- Loops In C++
  - **while**.
  - **do while**.
  - **for**.
  - **for** and while are essentially the same.
  - **do while**, has a slightly different execution flow.
  - Finally, range **for**. A range-based for loop.
- while
  - **while** (condition) { code to be executed }.
  - While loops will always check the condition first.
  - Use these when the amount of loop is unknown.
- for
  - **for** (init; condition; increment) { ... }.
  - Use these when you know how many times the loop will be run.
- do while
  - **do** { ... } **while** (condition);.
  - The code will be executed once regardless of the condition.
